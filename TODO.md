# Web Draw To-Do
- Handle race conditions
  - Timestamp? Action number?
- Selection copy buffer, for each client
  - Eliminate unnecessary raw image data of paste image actions in canvas files
  - Allow pasting copied data after switching to another tool
- Editing of shapes and lines in a similar fashion to selections
- Rotation of selections
- Edit settings of actions in action history (change colour, opacity, etc.)
- Multiple layers
  - Requires huge changes, but layers are super useful
- Text
